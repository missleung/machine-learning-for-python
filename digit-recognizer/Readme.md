# Digits Recognizer (Kaggle Dataset)

This repository contains Python code for digits recognizer taken from Kaggle. Here, I used convolutional neural network to predict the images of digits from 0 - 9 based on the data sets of pixels. Note that this work is still in progress - more tuning and optimizing results are still needed.

## Convolutional-NN
This is the main Python code to use convolutional neural network.
